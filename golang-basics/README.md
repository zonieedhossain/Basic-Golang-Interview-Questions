# Golang Basics

## 1. Key Features of Go

**Real-Life Example:** Go is like a multitasking chef in a kitchen. It can handle multiple tasks (concurrency), clean up after itself (garbage collection), and follow simple recipes (minimalistic syntax).

### Key Features:
- **Concurrency:** Run multiple tasks at once (like cooking and washing dishes simultaneously).
- **Simplicity:** Easy to learn and read (like a beginner-friendly recipe).
- **Fast Compilation:** Compiles code quickly (like instant noodles).
- **Garbage Collection:** Automatically frees up unused memory (like a self-cleaning kitchen).

## 2. How is Go Different from Other Programming Languages?

**Real-Life Example:** Go is like a hybrid car—modern and efficient. Unlike older cars (like C++ or Java), it’s designed for today’s needs.

### Differences:
- **No Classes:** Uses structs and interfaces instead of classes (like using building blocks instead of pre-made furniture).
- **Goroutines:** Lightweight threads for multitasking (like having multiple chefs in a kitchen).
- **Simplicity:** Less boilerplate code (like writing a short email instead of a long essay).

## 3. What is the Default Value (Zero Value) of Variables in Go?

**Real-Life Example:** If you declare a variable but don’t assign a value, Go gives it a default value (like an empty glass if you don’t pour water into it).

### Zero Values:
```go
int: 0
string: ""  // empty string
bool: false
pointer: nil  // no memory address
```

## 4. What is the Difference Between `var` and `:=` in Go?

**Real-Life Example:**
- `var` is like saying, “I’m going to buy a car” (you declare it but don’t assign it yet).
- `:=` is like saying, “I just bought a red car” (you declare and assign at the same time).

### Code Example:
```go
var x int      // Declare x (default value is 0)
y := 10        // Declare and assign y (type inferred as int)
```

---

## 5. What are Go's Built-in Types?

**Real-Life Example:** Go’s built-in types are like basic tools in a toolbox (hammer, screwdriver, etc.).

### Types:
- **Numbers:** `int`, `float64`, etc.
- **Strings:** `string`
- **Booleans:** `bool`
- **Collections:** `array`, `slice`, `map`

---

## 6. How Do You Declare Constants in Go?

**Real-Life Example:** Constants are like your birthdate—it never changes.

### Code Example:
```go
const Pi = 3.14
const AppName = "GoApp"
```

---

## 7. What is the Purpose of `iota` in Go?

**Real-Life Example:** `iota` is like a counter in a board game. It increments automatically as you move forward.

### Code Example:
```go
const (
Red = iota   // 0
Green        // 1
Blue         // 2
)
```

---

## 8. What is the Difference Between `new` and `make` in Go?

**Real-Life Example:**
- `new` is like buying a blank notebook (allocates memory but doesn’t initialize it).
- `make` is like buying a notebook and setting it up for a specific purpose (allocates and initializes memory).

### Code Example:
```go
ptr := new(int)       // Allocates memory for an int, returns a pointer
slice := make([]int, 5)  // Allocates and initializes a slice of length 5
```

---

## 9. What is the Difference Between an Array and a Slice in Go?

**Real-Life Example:**
- **Array:** Like a fixed-size suitcase (you can’t change its size).
- **Slice:** Like a stretchable backpack (you can add or remove items).

### Code Example:
```go
array := [3]int{1, 2, 3}  // Fixed size
slice := []int{1, 2, 3}   // Dynamic size
```

---

## 10. How Do You Create and Initialize a Slice in Go?

**Real-Life Example:** Creating a slice is like making a shopping list. You can add or remove items as needed.

### Code Example:
```go
// Create and initialize a slice
fruits := []string{"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
// Add an item
fruits = append(fruits, "orange")
```
